# Intelligent Crop Recommendation Portal üåæ

This repository hosts the Intelligent Crop Recommendation Portal, a machine learning-powered web application designed to assist farmers and agricultural specialists in selecting the best crops and fertilizers based on soil characteristics and environmental parameters. Developed by Aman Attar, this project leverages nutrient data and predictive models to make insightful agricultural recommendations.

For a detailed report on the project's development, please refer to the [Medium Article](https://amanattar.medium.com/intelligent-crop-recommendation-portal-using-ml-c081dd37fdaf).

## About the Project

The Intelligent Crop Recommendation Portal is a web-based recommendation system aimed at improving crop yield and fertilizer application by utilizing machine learning models. By analyzing soil nutrient levels and environmental factors, the portal provides recommendations on the most suitable crops, as well as optimal fertilizers and pesticides, fostering sustainable agricultural practices.

---

## Features

- **Crop Recommendation:** Suggests the best crops based on soil nutrient content and environmental data.
- **Fertilizer Recommendation:** Provides fertilizer suggestions tailored to crop types and soil characteristics.
- **Pesticide Guidance:** Recommends pesticides for managing common pests.
- **Data Visualization:** Offers visual insights on soil nutrients and crop recommendations.
- **User-Friendly Web Application:** Interactive interface for easy access to recommendations and information.

---

## Directory Structure

### Data Directory
- **Crop_NPK.csv** and **crop_recommendation.csv**: Contain nutrient values and recommendations for different crops.

### Models
- **cnn_model.ipynb** and **crop_model.ipynb**: Jupyter notebooks for training and evaluating models.
- **Trained_Model_1.h5**: Saved model file used for crop and fertilizer recommendations.

### Application Files
- **app.py**: Main application file, likely a Flask app for running the web server.
- **requirements.txt** and **runtime.txt**: Specify Python dependencies and runtime requirements.

### Frontend
- **Static**: Contains CSS, JavaScript, and image resources for the web application's front end.
- **Templates**: HTML templates such as `CropRecommendation.html` and `FertilizerRecommendation.html` for rendering the crop and fertilizer recommendation views.

### Utils Directory
- **fertilizer.py**: Contains utility functions for suggesting fertilizers based on crop nutrient requirements.
